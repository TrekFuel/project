<h2>Fancy upping your gravity game next year? Here are five top machines you should be considering.</h2>
<p>
  <cite>Written by James McKnight &bull; 5 April</cite>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/tags/mtb">Downhill</a> racing is all about rampaging down a mountain at
  breakneck speeds and bulldozing through the roughest, most
  gnarled terrain thinkable. The victor is he or she who manages to remain calm and composed, mind on the goal of
  achieving the fastest possible time from A to B no matter how technical or steep or fast the going gets.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing to consider is whether you want carbon fibre or aluminium. The choice comes down to personal preference
  – recent World Cup races have been won on every variant – and available budget. At the end of the day, whatever price
  point your budget fits you’ll get the same tried and tested geometry and suspension platform as the following five
  bikes’ race-winning high-end models.
</p>
<p>
  This is a selection of some of what have proven to be the best, most successful downhill bikes of recent years,
  machines that are available to buy in 2019. 27.5 or 29” wheels.
</p>

  <h2><i>
    <dt>Santa Cruz V10</dt>
  </i></h2>
  <dd>Santa Cruz’s V10 is so much a staple of the downhill race scene that it should probably be described as legendary.
    With good reason: the world’s very best have piloted various incarnations of this bike to World Cup and
    Championships victories, including <b>Steve Peat</b>, <b>Greg Minnaar</b> and most recently <b>Loris Vergier</b>.
    It’s a bike that has changed shape over the years, but the most recent iteration is perhaps its most radical – the
    Santa Cruz Syndicate burst onto the 2017 season as the first team on 29-inch wheels, and from then the prototype has
    developed into this well-refined beast, ready to be raced at the very top level, as <b>Vergier</b> and <b>Luca
      Shaw</b> proved all season long in 2018. SC have also produced a 27.5”-wheeled version for riders who prefer that
    wheel size.

    <dt>Commencal Supreme DH</dt>
  </i></h2>
  <dd>Commencal’s latest Supreme DH. Available in 27.5-or 29-inch wheeled versions and with components packages that are
    hard to beat for the money, the Supreme also has several feathers in its hat: namely the successes of more or less
    everyone who races on it! In 2018 alone, the bike reached World Cup podium countless times, with riders like <b>Amaury
      Pierron</b>, <b>Myriam Nicole</b>, <b>Remi Thirion</b>, <b>Thibaut Daprela</b>, <b>Cécile Ravanel</b> and <b>Reece
      Wilson</b> finding form aboard the bike from Andorra. Its high pivot, idler-pulley design and progressive sizing
    and angles (read: long and slack) help the Supreme eat up everything in its path.

    <dt>YT Tues</dt>
  </i></h2>
  <dd>YT Industries revolutionised the image of direct-sales-only brands when they signed <b>Aaron Gwin</b> in 2016.
    Could such a great value bike really take on the behemoths of World Cup racing? Absolutely: <b>Gwin</b> won his
    first World Cup aboard the bike and then went on to win the 2016 and '17 World Cup series. Another top DH athlete,
    <b>Vali Höll</b>, also flew the flag in 2018, taking the junior women’s World Cup and World Championships titles.
    Quite the CV. But beyond the highest ranks of racing, the Tues is a very rideable bike that is as suited to everyday
    enthusiasts and bike park riders as it is world champs. The price range reflects that: at just £2,399 for the
    well-equipped Tues AL (aluminium), it is one of the most affordable downhill bikes around.

    <dt>GT Fury 2019</dt>
  </i></h2>
  <dd>If ever a bike could be credited with a complete overhaul of one company’s fortunes, it must be this latest Fury
    from GT. <b>Martin Maes</b> turned the world’s attention to the Fury as he swept a muddy La Bresse clean with one of
    the most memorable World Cup wins in history in September 2018. Fresh onto the bike, <b>Maes</b> would then go on to
    take second place at the World Championships two weeks later. The Fury’s creator, <b>Luis Arraiz</b>, is well known
    for his progressive thinking, and the bike’s success is testament to his design. Not as great value compared to some
    of its peers in terms of components packages, with the Fury you are getting a highly refined, highly desirable and
    unique bike in carbon fibre.

    <dt>Mondraker Summum</dt>
  </i></h2>
  <dd>Mondraker’s Summum can be credited with starting the modern geometry revolution in downhill racing: when the
    Spanish brand released Forward Geometry the long, low and super slack frames were ground breaking. While the
    Summum’s design hasn’t changed drastically in a handful of years, it continues to be relevant with World Cup podiums
    a-plenty in recent seasons. Carbon fibre or aluminium models are available, both incorporating solid components
    packages and the same race-proven geometry and suspension design. The Summum’s only failing comes at its price tag.

  <h2><i></dt>Canyon Sender CF</dt></i></h2>
  <dd>Like fellow direct-sales-only brand YT, Canyon’s Sender offers unbelievable value – fantastic components hang off
    this race-winning bike at all its price points. Its two lower-end aluminium models match the same proven geometry
    and refined lines as their higher-end carbon siblings, making the Sender one of the most accessible race bikes on
    the market. To ensure your next World Cup win, go for the priciest option, the team replica.
